#######  Usage  ###################
#
#    #!/usr/bin/env bash
#    set -eu
#    # Assuming tegonal's scripts were fetched with gget - adjust location accordingly
#    dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(realpath "$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" &>/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src")"
#    source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"
#
#    source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/utility/source-once.sh"
#
#    sourceOnce "foo.sh"    # creates a variable named foo__sh which acts as guard and sources foo.sh
#    sourceOnce "foo.sh"    # will source nothing as foo__sh is already defined
#    unset foo__sh          # unsets the guard
#    sourceOnce "foo.sh"    # is sourced again and the guard established
#
#
#
#    # creates a variable named bar__foo__sh which acts as guard and sources bar/foo.sh
#    sourceOnce "bar/foo.sh"
#
#    # will source nothing, only the parent dir + file is used as identifier
#    # i.e. the corresponding guard is bar__foo__sh and thus this file is not sourced
#    sourceOnce "asdf/bar/foo.sh"
